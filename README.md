- This repository contains the code and resources for the Stellar Classification project, a capstone project aimed at classifying stars based on their physical characteristics. 
- Using a machine learning approach, this project identifies star types by analyzing features such as temperature, luminosity, and spectral class.
- This project showcases key steps in data processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

  
- The objective of this project is to classify stars into categories using supervised machine learning techniques.
- By leveraging labeled stellar data, we aim to develop a robust model that can accurately predict a star's type based on various features.
